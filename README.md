# OmaControl

One window for every Omarchy setting and the machine underneath it: Hyprland,
keybindings and themes, alongside Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, disks, processes and
packages.

<p align="center"><img src="preview.png" alt="The OmaControl window, open on the Overview page" width="600"></p>

Omarchy's settings live in a dozen places: `shell.json`, the Hyprland config,
each application's own config, `~/.XCompose`, and a long list of commands.
OmaControl puts them in one window, alongside the live state of the machine —
audio, network, bluetooth, power, disks and processes — so a few widgets can
leave the bar if you want the space for others.

- **Find anything.** Type "blur" or "border" and every setting that touches it
  appears with its current value, whatever file it normally lives in.
- **Undo.** Anything you changed is marked, and goes back one setting at a time
  or all at once.
- **Keyboard first.** Arrows or `j`/`k` move, `h`/`l` change a value,
  `Alt`+arrows change page, `/` searches, `Esc` closes.

## Why I built it

I wanted a fast overview of everything I could change, and an easier way to find
out which settings Hyprland actually has. Easier management of keybindings and
`~/.XCompose` was the other part.

Dropping a few widgets like audio from the bar frees space for ones I get more
out of. And hopefully someone else finds it useful too.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/twiking/omacontrol.git --enable
```

## Migrate from OmaSettings

Install OmaControl beside it and restart the shell:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/twiking/omacontrol.git --enable
omarchy restart shell
```

Open OmaControl. The Overview page says your OmaSettings settings have not
come across yet; press **Bring them over**. A few seconds later every setting
you made in OmaSettings is marked as changed, and "Undo all" can put each one
back. If the shell reloads its plugins meanwhile, the window closes and comes
back on its own.

OmaControl is the same window renamed, but a rename is not free for a program
that writes into other people's files. Six things on disk carry the old name —
the store of what you changed and what it was before, the generated Hyprland
file, the `require` line that loads it, the marked block in `bindings.lua`, the
`.bak` copies of your originals, and the bar slot the gear sits in — and the
new window recognises none of them until they are renamed. The gear keeps its
place in the bar, and OmaSettings is switched off but left installed;
`omarchy plugin remove io.github.twiking.omasettings` removes it.

Every original is copied into `~/.local/state/omacontrol/migration-<time>/`
first, with an `undo.sh` beside them, so the whole thing is one command to
reverse.

The offer is only made before you change anything in OmaControl: a change gives
it a store of its own, and bringing the old one over would overwrite it. To
see the plan or run it from a terminal instead:

```sh
P=~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.twiking.omacontrol
$P/bin/omacontrol-migrate            # prints what would change, changes nothing
$P/bin/omacontrol-migrate --apply    # carries it out
```

## Usage

Click the gear in the bar to open the window, or find it in the launcher as
OmaControl.

### The badge on the gear

By default the gear shows a badge for three things:

- **No network:** a click opens Network.
- **Battery at 10 % or under**, for the laptop or a Bluetooth device: a click
  opens Power or Bluetooth.
- **How many of Night light, Do not disturb and Stay awake are on.**

If your bar already shows any of these, turn that part off in
**OmaControl → Settings**, or from a terminal:

```sh
omarchy bar set io.github.twiking.omacontrol showActiveSwitchCount false --json
omarchy bar set io.github.twiking.omacontrol showNetworkWarning false --json
omarchy bar set io.github.twiking.omacontrol showBatteryWarnings false --json
```

Hovering over the gear still lists everything, whatever the badge shows. Set an
option back to `true` to bring that part of the badge back.

### Offline mode

On its own, OmaControl makes four requests: the news from omarchy.org, the
plugin catalogue and its stats, and a public address lookup at Cloudflare.
To stop all four, add `"offline": true` to `~/.config/omarchy/omacontrol.json`
(or set `OMACONTROL_OFFLINE=1` in the shell's environment):

```sh
f=~/.config/omarchy/omacontrol.json
jq '.offline = true' "$f" > "$f.tmp" && mv "$f.tmp" "$f"
```

Each one then shows whatever it last fetched. Things you click yourself, such
as opening a headline or running a speed test, still go out.

## How it writes

Your config files are never parsed and rewritten, since that is how a settings
app eats someone's setup. Instead:

- **Hyprland settings** are applied live with `hyprctl eval` and written to a
  file of its own, `~/.config/hypr/omacontrol.lua`, loaded last from a single
  `require` line appended to your `hyprland.lua`. Your own files keep saying
  exactly what you wrote.
- **Keybindings** live in a marked block in `bindings.lua`. Everything outside
  the markers is copied through untouched.
- **Everything else**, meaning Herdr, tmux and Neovim, is edited one value at a
  time, in place, keeping the comment attached to the line it belongs to.

Overview, Storage and Processes write nothing at all. They report, and where
there is something to *do* they hand off to the command that owns it — the same
`omarchy-toggle-nightlight` the bar uses, `udisksctl` for a mount, `snapper` for
a snapshot. That is why those pages cannot disagree with the bar.

Before the first write to any file you could have written yourself, a copy is
kept beside it as `<file>.omacontrol.bak`. Every write is checked in the
format's own terms, with `herdr config check`, by compiling the Lua, or by
applying the tmux option, and rolled back if it fails.

Nothing here needs root, and nothing is installed on your behalf.

## Remove

```sh
omarchy plugin remove io.github.twiking.omacontrol
```

The launcher entry it wrote is deleted with it.
