# A program's command line is readable by every user on the machine, through
# /proc/<pid>/cmdline, for as long as it runs. jq takes its variables there, and
# what this window hands it is often a document read from a private file:
# shell.json, with whatever tokens and keys a widget keeps in its settings; the
# store, which holds those settings while the widget is switched off; a
# plugin's remote, which can carry credentials. A marketplace review found the
# whole of shell.json going past that way on every state read.
#
# So no value reaches jq through argv. Each `--arg` and `--argjson` travels in
# the environment of that one jq process instead, which /proc shows to its own
# user alone, and is bound back to the same name at the head of the filter —
# `$ARGS.named` included. Callers go on writing `--arg name value`: a rule each
# of three hundred call sites has to remember is a rule the next one forgets.
#
# The options go first, then `--`, the program and its inputs, which is how
# jq reads them wherever they were written. An option short of its value is
# refused here rather than handed on, since handing on the original arguments
# would put every value before it back on the command line. So is a program
# that opens with `import` or `include`, which has to come before anything
# this could put in front of it, and an `-L` in a cluster; nothing here writes
# either.
#
# `env.X` rather than `$ENV.X`, because a caller may name a variable ENV. And
# `--argjson` that is not JSON fails when the filter runs, with status 5 rather
# than 2, and without echoing the value: checking it up front would cost a
# second jq for every one of them, and every caller only asks whether jq
# failed.

# A pipe ends when the last writer closes it, not when the producer exits, and
# a command that backgrounds a daemon without redirecting it hands that daemon
# the pipe — Omarchy's nightlight toggle does, with hyprsunset. Waiting for the
# end then waits for the daemon, and the window, which runs one command at a
# time, stops answering. So the wait is for the producer, and the reader gets a
# moment to drain what it wrote; after that the answer is taken as it stands.
#
# The reader is never killed, and goes on swallowing whatever comes after the
# cap. A daemon left holding a pipe nobody reads dies of SIGPIPE on its next
# log line: hyprsunset did, a request after it was switched on. `stdbuf -o0`
# so what `head` has read is in the file when the wait gives up on it.
#
# Still a pipe, and not a file read afterwards: a file is only cut down once
# the producer is done, and `yes` fills a gigabyte of /tmp, which is memory,
# every fifth of a second. Past the cap it goes nowhere.
#
# The status is the producer's, as it was through `pipefail`, so a producer
# that failed is told apart from one that said nothing.
