# — the row says how many commits are coming and what they say.
#
# It does not run as a child of the window, though. The shell watches the

# on any change under it — this window's host included — so a `git merge` in
# there takes the window down while the merge is still running. A child of it
# would be killed part-way through, and the answer would die with the window
# that asked. So the work is detached, says what it did in the cache the page
# reads, and then brings the window back.

# Bringing the window back afterwards. The reload takes it down mid-update, so
# the job that survived is the only thing left that knows it should return —
# and it has to wait its turn: the shell may still be tearing down, rebuilding,
# or (having been asked to rescan) starting the plugins up again. Summoning

# upwards, and a plugin copied into a dotfiles repository would answer with
# the dotfiles' remote and commit.

# this machine's global excludes or `info/exclude`: a plugin that builds a
# helper on install leaves output its repository already declares, and only
# a file it does not account for makes the copy different from the commit.
# That leaves the `.gitignore` files themselves, which are read whether
# tracked or not — so an untracked one, which could hide itself and anything

# ------------------------------------------------ what the marketplace says
#
# A plugin is someone else's code running inside the shell, and the two
# questions that raises — who wrote this, and has anyone looked at it — cannot
# be answered on the machine. They are answered at plugins.omarchy.org, whose
# catalogue is a static document, and by the engagement API behind it, which
# holds the hearts.
#
# Both are the network, so neither is ever on a poll: the page asks at most
# once a day, says when it last asked, and shows the previous answer until
# then. Same shape as the package check, for the same reason.
#
# The catalogue is nine megabytes describing three and a half thousand
# plugins, of which a machine has twenty. It is asked for compressed, streamed
# through jq and reduced to those twenty before any of it is kept, so what
# lands in the cache is a few hundred bytes a plugin.
#
# **The id finds the listing; the copy has to earn it.** A listing is a
# repository, and a verification is one commit of it. A fork that kept the id,
# or a copy edited where it sits, shares the id and none of what was
# reviewed. So `plugins_report` gives a copy its listing only when it was
# cloned from the listed repository, and the badge only when it is at the
# verified commit with its files unchanged (`plugin_checkout`). Handing
# someone else's verification to code nobody looked at is the one mistake a
# badge like this must not make.
